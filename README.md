This website was made from the classes of [Kevin Powell](https://github.com/kevin-powell/reponsive-web-design-bootcamp) on the [FreeCodeCamp's channel on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srvUrASNj0s). 

This was my first exercise training responsiveness on websites with different viewports.
